This is Eddy Borja's coding exercise solution as requested by Vestwell. It has been written as a node module in Javascript.

### Getting Started

You must have Node installed on the machine running the exercise. Run the command "npm install" to install any dependencies for the project. If you use yarn, run "yarn install" instead.

To run tests, use the command "npm test" or "yarn test".

### API

The Chamber class expects to be initialized with a single init string parameter. 

The chamber instance can then produce an array of animation frames with the "animate" method, which expects a single integer parameter that represents the movement speed of the particles per frame of animation.
